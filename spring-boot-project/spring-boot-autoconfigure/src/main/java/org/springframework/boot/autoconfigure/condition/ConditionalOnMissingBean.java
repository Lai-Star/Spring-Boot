/**
 * {@link Conditional @Conditional} that only matches when no beans meeting the specified
 * requirements are already contained in the {@link BeanFactory}. None of the requirements
 * must be met for the condition to match and the requirements do not have to be met by
 * the same bean.
 * <p>
 * When placed on a {@code @Bean} method, the bean class defaults to the return type of
 * the factory method:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * &#064;Configuration
 * public class MyAutoConfiguration {
 *
 *     &#064;ConditionalOnMissingBean
 *     &#064;Bean
 *     public MyService myService() {
 *         ...
 *     }
 *
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * In the sample above the condition will match if no bean of type {@code MyService} is
 * already contained in the {@link BeanFactory}.
 * <p>
 * The condition can only match the bean definitions that have been processed by the
 * application context so far and, as such, it is strongly recommended to use this
 * condition on auto-configuration classes only. If a candidate bean may be created by
 * another auto-configuration, make sure that the one using this condition runs after.
